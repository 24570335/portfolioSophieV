As an assignment in University, I was able to pair up with an incredible team and together produce a truss bridge this semester. It underwent many CAD revisions, followed by a cardboard prototype during initial stages. After this, we were able to get our design laser-cut and then proceeded to file and rivet in order to piece the bridge together. The final product was then coated in a spray paint of pink for aesthetically pleasing purposes!
