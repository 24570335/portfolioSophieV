It was a great experience participating in Talkfest as a volunteer for Autumn 2023. Our group of volunteers helped run Talkfest sessions for seven weeks, dedicating two hours every Friday afternoon to create a comfortable environment for international students to practice their English and make friends along the way. I had a great time meeting many lovely students, learning about peoples different experiences and cultures, and growing a strong bond as the weeks went by.
