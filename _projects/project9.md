Currently in the process of making a step-counter PCB for my subject in my first semester of my third year. It has been a great experience to research topics I am passionate about: electronics. From recapping the basics of RC circuits to learning about low pass filters, simulating and being able to test it, it has been a great learning experience.

It has been a great opportunity to read Art of Electronics by Paul Horowitz, and gain hands on practice with oscilloscopes and waveform generators - and remember all their powerful features when testing! My subcircuit was designated to create a low pass filter, and it has taken lots of research to justify what order, what circuit topology, what filter topology, what op-amp I have chosen. It has also been great to see the difference between simulating a circuit compared to its behaviour in real life - never completely the same, and important to test rather than relying solely on the theoretical aspects.

Images include reference to a sweep to view the original signal compared to the outputted signal which will attenuate high frequencies over time. As well as a visualisation of how an accelerometer's noise (high frequencies) will be significantly attenuated and maintain better SNR properties. Although here the image quality is not great, I want to use bit-maps from an oscilloscope instead.
