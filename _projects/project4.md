With a group of twenty other students I had the chance to visit Nepal for Humanitarian Engineering at the start of 2024. We had the opportunity to visit a small village called Gati, located in the third most prone to landslide region in Nepal. In this village we were tasked with creating a Risk Assessment Plan for environmental disasters. Our group chose to focus on immediate response after natural disasters, this included encouraging an evacuation plan to be taught in schools and an alarm system to be able to communicate directions across the wide town.

It was a really incredible experience to be able to apply practical engineering skills in an international setting. I was able to improve on my communication skills, simplifying sentences into key ideas that can easily be translated.
