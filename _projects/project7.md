Applying for the RTSA University Challenge. Our team was chosen to attend the three sessions at Arup's headquarters located in Sydney's CBD. Over these three sessions we will be able to network with industry professionals as well as hold a presentation to relay our creative insights to creative additions in the rail industry

Our solution focussed on a human-centred design approach that scoped out the problem statement over multiple slides. We ultimately decided that incorporating external OLED displays on trains to indicate availability of seatings (like that of a cinema), would increase pedestrian comfort through its more effective pedestrian traffic control. On the last session all teams took turns sharing their insights infront of a judging panelist. This was great experience in improving our public speaking as well as aligning our powerpoint to best fit their criteria
