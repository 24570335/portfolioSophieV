Over the past few months, I’ve had the incredible opportunity to contribute to the Stage 2 IntelliForce Tooling project, focusing on innovative hydraulic tooling safety and usability design.

I am massively grateful for my coworkers and their valuable insights and experience, which significantly shaped my approach and deepened my understanding of the design process. I’m also grateful to BTP for the thoughtful discussions, meaningful feedback, and the opportunity to explore the site firsthand.

Throughout this journey, I immersed myself in engineering design and problem-solving, honing my skills in software, embedded design, and CAD. More importantly, I gained a deeper appreciation for the justification process, understanding that strong design decisions require thorough research, comparison, and clear reasoning.

This experience has been an invaluable learning curve, and I’m excited to carry these insights forward into future projects!
