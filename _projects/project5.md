The FSAE competition in Melbourne 2023 was an incredible opportunity to see the efforts of many engineers from many universities join together to race cars designed with unique and intelligent features. Hearing about the designs that other teams incorporated from the way they wired their electrical looms, to how many motors they included, to which type of motor controller they purchased were all very enlightening questions which made me appreciate the diversity that student teams could reach despite a uniform set of FSAE rules to follow.

Additionally, from a UTS standpoint I was very inspired by everyone's commitment and tireless strength to push through the competition and fix the components despite the time-induced stress. It felt like a true taster to the industry, where in the moment things can go south and it takes immense adaptability and motivation to continue developing the final product. Overall, I am eager to take the knowledge and inspiration I saw over these four days into 2024 and apply myself into more of the electrical and data skill required of Motorsports Electric.
