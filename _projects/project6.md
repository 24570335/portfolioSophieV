The MEMS microphone project consisted of the STM32F4 chip as well as a microphone extension CCA02M2, to create a karaoke machine. It was a fun and creative project idea to combine the use of Artificial intelligence to support a Speech-To-Text API as well as a volume identifier to help create a proper karaoke machine.
The main reflections from this assignment initially was the lack of understanding of exactly how a microphone works, the realisation to study this in-depth came later in the project, and therefore may have limited the overall progress of achieving sound recognition using the STM chip. Additionally, there were many struggles in between where the team had to pull long hours to understand how to work around a missing IOC file as well as how to properly read data sheets and use their respective registers. Looking forward, there were still many aspects the team and I wanted to achieve, one of them being, creating a FFT (fast Fourier transform) to be able to isolate frequencies sung into the karaoke machine and therefore add and extra layer of challenge by scoring the frequency of the singer.

Overall I am very proud of this project and the consistency we showed to debug the issues that came up, ultimately landing us first place in Embedded Mechatronics Systems with this MEMS microphone system.
