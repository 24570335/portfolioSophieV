In the morning I was assigned to running morning games, where it's important to create a welcoming and fun environment for the kids just walking in. It is very insightful for myself to learn what's the best way of managing a group that is constantly expanding, as well as keeping them entertained. However, very quickly it becomes natural and the kids introduce themselves to each other and have big smiles on their faces.

After this, I was assigned to co-leading a room with another tutor. This was a fantastic experience to team manage and create an environment which considers everyone's learning pace.

Furthermore, after lunch I was able to lead "Mentor Hangz", a great opportunity for kids in years 10 - 12 to be able to have a chat with tutors and ask any of their questions regarding HSC, University or future career pathways.

Overall, the day went by very smoothly, and the kids had lovely feedback to provide after the end of day survey.
